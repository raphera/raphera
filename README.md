## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Raphael Freitas (Raphera)

I'm a 23-year-old electronics technician and software developer, currently finishing my Bachelor's degree in Science and Technology. I'm passionate about embedded electronics, microcontrollers, and web technologies.

Currently, I'm working at T-Systems, where I develop software for Mercedes-Benz Brazil, creating software that interfaces with truck electronics and working on automation and production management software. In my free time, I enjoy 3D printing, home automation, and CNC projects.

I'm also starting to explore my passion for web technologies and discovering the endless possibilities of integrating them with embedded development. In the future, I aim to become fluent in web technologies and create innovative solutions that combine embedded electronics with web technology.
